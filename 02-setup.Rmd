# Setup

## Loading required libraries

Our first step is to load the `inventory` and `BY2011` packages.

```{r libraries, message = FALSE}
library(inventory)
library(BY2011)
```

Wait for it --- `inventory` imports a lot of stuff! You will see a lot of <span style="color:red; font-family=monospace">red message text</span> scroll by.

## Peeking at data

`BY2011_annual_emission_data` is *tabular data* supplied by the `BY2011`
package. Since we invoked `library(BY2011)`, we have access to it. **Here is what it looks like.**

```{r BY2011_annual_emission_data-head, eval=FALSE}
head(BY2011_annual_emission_data)
```

```{r BY2011-annual-emission-data-head-kable, echo=FALSE}
kable(
  head(BY2011_annual_emission_data),
  caption = "First six rows of `BY2011_annual_emission_data`.")
```
