# Introduction

After working through the material in this cookbook, you will understand how to chart:

- annual emission estimates, like those in `BY` or `RY` data;
- annual growth factors, normalized to any year;
- annual throughputs;
- annual emission factors; and
- annualized control factors.

To demonstrate, we'll use some data from the `BY2011` package. Everything will work in **exactly the same way with RY, PY, or BY2015 data**.
