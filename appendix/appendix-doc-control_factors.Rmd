## Control factors {#appendix-doc-control_factors}

Documentation for three key functions is printed out below.

- **`DB_control_factors()`** is a legacy-format API for DataBank (`t0326`). In its output, **`Cd`, `Ed`, and `Ep`** are key. See `help(t0326)` as well.

- **`annualize_DB_control_factors()`**, which itself depends on **`calculate_Fd_and_Fc()`**, implements the annualization algorithm mentioned in the chapter on [Control factors]. The References section of `help(calculate_Fd_and_Fc)` contains a reference to a PDF that describes the algorithm in several pages.
